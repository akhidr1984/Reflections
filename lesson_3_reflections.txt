1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when i'm going to be collaborating with other developers and i want everyone to have access to the project

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

so i can have control on which changes to pull and which to not

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: copies repos on github onto my account on github to be able to work on the source coude myself if i don't have permission to modify the original (github to github)
clones: downloads the commit history of a repo from github to my local machine while setting the github repo as a remote
branch: commits that are on a different path from the master path and who can have any experimental changes made to them while not affecting the master path

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

to be able to tell if other people made changes to the remote that are not in my local repo
